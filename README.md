# Applied-Data-Science
This developing repository contains the teaching materials for my CUSP course on applied data science. They are written in either R script 
or Python 3.X contained in Jupyter notebooks. I've done my best to ensure the syntax still works, especially for the Bayesian lecture.  

May 15, 2017 Update: Yahoo Finance has either altered or discontinued its API functionality.  

June 12, 2017 Update: I've added older R materials on neural networks and other classifiers, including XGBoost and tsne.  Unfortunately, 
MXNET has not been compiled for R 3.2.2, so that API does not currently work.  I will aim to develop a Juptyer notebook in Python to 
address neural networks and other classifiers.

June 16, 2017 Update: Ran Aroussi has developed a fix that saves accessibility to Yahoo Finance.  Thanks, Ran!  Great stuff.
See the forked directory.  I will update the libraries later in preparation for teaching.

July 22, 2017 Update: I've added a notebook on deep learning with an application in finance.  It uses the Keras API and Google's TensorFlow as the backend.  (TensorFlow is very impressive, as is Keras.)

March 10, 2018 Update: Time series notebook and lab updated.  

Feel free to use and adapt.
